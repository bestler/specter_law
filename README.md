# Legal Hackathon Word Add-in Scaffold

This project is a Microsoft Word Add-in using Office.js, React, and TypeScript.

## Structure
- `src/ui/` – React UI components (Taskpane)
- `src/office/` – Office.js interaction logic
- `src/logic/` – Business logic (diff, LLM analysis)

No business logic is implemented yet. This is a plain scaffold for further development.
